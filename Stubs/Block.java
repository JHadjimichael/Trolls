//This implements the block, which is the main superclass of the game.
//The block has no attributes, including variables and methods.
//The purpose of the block is to act as the base of the array, and to link all other objects in it.
//In the array which represents the world, every space is a Block
//In the graphics this is displayed as a white box with a black outline, creating the grid pattern.
