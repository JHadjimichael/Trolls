# Open TrollDriver.java, and run the program
# You will approach a welcome screen with a start button. 
# By clicking on the start button, you will begin the game
# In the game, there will be a white screen with a blue cube and green cubes. 
# You will be playing as the blue cube, also known as a player, and the green cubes are the trolls
# As a player, you will be able to:
    # Move up(up arrow or W key)
    # Move down(down arrow or S key)
    # Move left(left arrow or A key)
    # Move right(right arrow or D key)
    # Move diagonally up to the left(Q key)
    # Move diagonally up to the right(E key)
    # Move diagonally down to the right(C key)
    # Move diagonally down to the left(Z key)
    # Go to a random place on the board(aka game screen) using the T key
    # Allow the trolls to come to you(space key)
# The trolls will:
    # Move to the player in the shortest possible path(therefore, diagonally)
    # If you land on the same position as the troll, you will be eaten, and you will lose the game
    # Therefore, the whole purpose of this game is to avoid the trolls, and make them run into each other. 
    # When two trolls are at the same position on the board, they will die, and turn into a corpse.
    # corpses are represented by red squares/cubes on the screen
# Winning/Losing Conditions:
    # If all the trolls are killed, and the player(you) is not dead(if you see all corpses on the screen and one player), you win
    # If you are eaten by a troll, you lose.
# After the Game:
    # At the end of the game, there will be a screen that tells you whether or won or lost, based on the end result of the game(win or loss)
    # Regardless, on both screen, you will have two options:
      # Restart: Button that will allow you to play again
      # Quit: Button that will close the window.
